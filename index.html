	<h2><strong>WISHES</strong></h2>
 
    <h3>I would like to adopt a kitten, and here are my motivations. Adopting a kitten can be a very rewarding experience. Kittens bring a lot of love, affection and fun to their foster families. However, it is important to remember that kittens need a lot of care and attention to develop into healthy, happy cats. You'll need to feed them regularly, groom them, play with them and take them to the vet for routine check-ups. It's also important to socialize them with other cats and people to help them become confident and loving pets. Ultimately, adopting a kitten can be a long-term commitment, but the reward is a loyal and loving pet for life.</h3>
